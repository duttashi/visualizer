# 1. Correlation
# The following plots help to examine how well correlated two variables are using Scatterplot
# Whenever you want to understand the nature of relationship between two variables, invariably the first choice is the scatterplot.
# can be drawn using geom_point(). Additionally, geom_smooth which draws a smoothing line (based on loess) by default, can be tweaked to draw the line of best fit by setting method='lm'.
